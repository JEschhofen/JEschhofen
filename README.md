- Hi, I’m @JEschhofen
- I’m a Music Director and Sound Designer for a Professional Theatre with an interest in Mechanical Keyboards.
- I’m currently learning QMK and the very basics of C (never done any actual programming prior to QMK).
- I have a Planck v6, and I'm working on customizing the layers, including using a rotary encoder.
